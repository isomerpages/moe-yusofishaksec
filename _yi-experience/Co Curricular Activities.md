<h1><strong>Co-Curricular Activities</strong></h1>
<p><strong>VISION</strong>
</p>
<p>To provide students with a holistic experience in education.</p>
<p>CCA is an integral part of the school curriculum. It complements the schoolâ€™s
academic programme. Each CCA seeks to teach students the skills and knowledge
necessary and relevant in their own areas, as well as to instill in students
leadership, character, and values in line with the school vision and mission.</p>
<p>CCA is compulsory for all students in secondary schools. The CCAs offered
by the school are as follows:</p>
