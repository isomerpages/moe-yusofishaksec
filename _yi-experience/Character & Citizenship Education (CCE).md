Character & Citizenship Education (CCE) in YI serves to guide students to be lifelong learners and active contributors to society through the school’s Co-curriculum.

All the programs that the school embarks on are closely aligned to the CCE2021 framework, and we seek to empower students with the school values as well as equip them with essential SEL competencies. This is done through the various approaches shown below.

With a strong foundation in values, it is hoped that students will make the right choices in life. They will then be able to exhibit the 21st Century Competencies and eventually influence others to exhibit the 21st Century Competencies.
