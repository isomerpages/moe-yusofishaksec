# **Applied Learning Programme (ALP)**

### STEM for the Strategic Development of a Sustainable and Smart City (S4TEM@YI)

Our **S4TEM@YI** ALP adopts an integrative approach in providing a wide range of learning opportunities for students to embrace and engage in STEM learning. Aligned with the whole-of-nation sustainability movement, the ALP supports and is an extension of the MOE Eco Stewardship Programme in schools.

 Students will gain exposure to STEM through school-wide activities, such as urban farming, coding and aeronautics, and deepen their thinking skills through their participation in STEM-related curricula activities planned in collaboration with experts from the relevant fields. Our ALP provides a conducive environment for students to immerse in and be empowered to be future-ready community connectors, making meaningful contributions to STEM-related areas in our society.

### Key Programme

* **STEMx Inter-disciplinary Work (IPW) Learning Experience**

In today’s dynamic world, students will have the opportunities to learn how to engage with STEM-related issues and process information that is not subject-specific. They will cultivate and put into action future-ready habits that are essential in the development of **Leaders For Tomorrow** at YISS. STEMx IPW is also a learning experience which aims to provide students with the opportunities to build and construct knowledge for various areas of learning that they are exposed to through the school’s ALP and curriculum. This is the principle on which STEMx IPW has been anchored and developed.

Through the STEMx IPW learning experience, our students will be able to better appreciate elements of the Singapore Green Plan 2030 and the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development which are related to the theme of Sustainability and Climate Change.

* **YI Sustainability Month (22 March – 22 April 2022)**
