# **Learning for Life Programme (LLP)**

### Nurturing Honourable Leaders for Tomorrow (YI LEAD+)

An honourable LEADER in every Yusoffian. We nurture honourable leaders for tomorrow who are grounded in the core values of Honourable Leaders, way makers who inspire social action, possess a global outlook and adopt a growth mind-set.

Our LLP serves to broaden students’ global outlook and deepen students’ acquisition of 21st Century Competencies (21CC) to nurture them to be Leaders for Tomorrow. Through a comprehensive LLP programme, our student leaders will be empowered to be of positive influence to their peers and juniors, and contribute to the greater good.
