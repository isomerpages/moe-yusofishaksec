<h1><strong>Education and Career Guidance</strong></h1>
<h3>ECG Counsellor</h3>
<p>Our ECG Counsellor, Ms Lim Hui Ching, comes to YISS on&nbsp;<strong>Mondays </strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Wednesdays</strong>&nbsp;to
provide support to Yusoffians (individually or in small groups) in making
informed decisions on post-secondary education and career options. Students
who would like to explore more about subject choices, enquire about post-secondary
education pathways or find out more about their career interests, strengths
and passions, can have a chat with her.</p>
