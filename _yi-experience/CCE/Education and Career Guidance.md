# **Education and Career Guidance**

### ECG Counsellor

Our ECG Counsellor, Ms Priscilla Chong, comes to YISS on **Tuesdays** and **Wednesdays** to provide support to Yusoffians (individually or in small groups) in making informed decisions on post-secondary education and career options. Students who would like to explore more about subject choices, enquire about post-secondary education pathways or find out more about their career interests, strengths and passions, can have a chat with her.
