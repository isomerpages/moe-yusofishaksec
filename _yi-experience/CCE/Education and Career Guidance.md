<h1><strong>Education &amp; Career Guidance</strong></h1>
<p>Education and Career Guidance (ECG) experiences equip students with the
necessary knowledge, skills and values to make informed decisions at each
key education stage for successful transition from school to further education
or work. Students are then able to navigate and manage their career pathways
and develop a spirit of lifelong learning throughout their lives. Examples
of ECG experiences include Career Days, Learning Journeys to Post-Secondary
Education Institutions (PSEIs) and/or industries, as well as ECG Fairs
and Talks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The goals of ECG are to support students in:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Discovering Purpose - Who am I? Nurture students' self-awareness to support
them in discovering how they can meaningfully play a part in their community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exploring Opportunities - Where do I want to go? Develop students' self-directedness
and confidence to explore and leverage education and career opportunities
while respecting the value of all occupations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Staying Relevant - How do I get there? Build students' adaptability and
resilience to embrace the need for lifelong learning.&nbsp;</p>
