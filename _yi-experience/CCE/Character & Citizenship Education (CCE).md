<h1><strong>Character &amp; Citizenship Education</strong></h1>
<h4><strong>Why does Character &amp; Citizenship Education (CCE) matter at YISS?</strong></h4>
<p>At Yusof Ishak Secondary School, Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)
is the heartbeat of our school culture. Anchored in our vision of Leaders
for Tomorrow and guided by our YISS Positive Education Framework (LE+ADeR),
CCE shapes students who are grounded in values, guided by purpose, and
committed to serving others.</p>
<p>We believe that every school experience is a CCE opportunity. Character
is not developed in isolation - it is intentionally nurtured through lessons,
co-curricular activities, leadership roles, Values in Action (YI Changemaker),
learning journeys, camps and everyday interactions.</p>
<p>CCE at YISS goes beyond knowledge acquisition. It strengthens identity,
deepens relationships and builds moral courage to make sound choices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>What are we building?</strong></h4>
<p>Our CCE programme is designed to nurture every Yusoffian into:</p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Becoming Their Best Selves</strong>
</p>
<p>Students develop a grounded identity, practise self-management, and demonstrate
resilience and purpose as they grow into confident, values-driven individuals.</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Becoming Caring Friends &amp; Collaborative Peer Supporters</strong>
</p>
<p>Students nurture positive relationships, appreciate diversity, and demonstrate
empathy, peer support and teamwork to strengthen their class and school
community.</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Becoming Active Citizens Who Lead for the Greater Good</strong>
</p>
<p>Students act with integrity and courage, influence others positively,
and contribute meaningfully to their family, school, community, Singapore
and the world.</p>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Becoming Future-Ready, Adaptive &amp; Self-Directed Learners</strong>
</p>
<p>Students develop curiosity, agency, digital discernment and adaptability
to navigate education and career pathways confidently as lifelong learners.</p>
<p>These outcomes reflect our commitment to nurturing Curiosity, Creativity
and Confidence in our Yusoffians, empowering them to contribute to the
greater good.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Our CCE programme is aligned with the CCE 2021 framework and is intentionally
structured around three big ideas:</p>
<p><strong>Identity</strong>
</p>
<p>Who am I? Who do I want to become?</p>
<p><strong>Relationships</strong>
</p>
<p>How do I relate to myself and others?</p>
<p><strong>Choices</strong>
</p>
<p>How do I make responsible, values-based decisions?</p>
<p>These ideas are taught across key domains such as:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>National Education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Education &amp; Career Guidance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mental Health Education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cyber Wellness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Family Education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sexuality Education</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Students learn and apply values and social-emotional skills such as empathy,
moral reasoning, resilience, help-seeking, digital discernment and civic
responsibility - both online and offline.</p>
