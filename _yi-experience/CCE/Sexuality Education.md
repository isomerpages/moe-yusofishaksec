<h1><strong>Sexuality Education</strong></h1>
<h3>YUSOF ISHAK SECONDARY SCHOOL</h3>
<p><strong>Moe Sexuality Education in Schools</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexuality Education (SEd)
in schools aims to enable students to understand the physiological, social
and emotional changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy and
rewarding relationships with others, including those with members of the
opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality
matters. SEd is premised on the importance of the family as the basic unit
of society. This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual marriages and
stable nuclear family units with extended family support. The teaching
and learning of SEd is based on respect for the values and beliefs of the
different ethnic and religious communities in Singapore on sexuality issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>Goals</strong> of
Sexuality Education are to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Support students in managing their physiological, social and emotional
changes as they grow up and develop safe and healthy relationships.</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guide
students to make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality
matters.</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Help students
develop a moral compass and respect for themselves and others by having
positive mainstream values and attitudes about sexuality that are premised
on the family as the basic unit of society.</p>
<p>&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>Key Messages</strong> of
Sexuality Education are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others;</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Build
positive relationships based on love and respect (which are the foundation
for strong families);</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make responsible
decisions for yourself, your family and society; and</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abstinence
before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV and unintended
pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved ones.</p>

<p><strong><em><u>eTeens</u></em><u> Programme</u></strong>:</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>eTeens</em> is a programme that
was developed by Health Promotion Board, in collaboration with the Ministry
of Education, to provide Secondary 3 students with accurate information
on STIs, HIV and protection from a health perspective. With the formation
of the Communicable Diseases Agency (CDA) on 1 April 2025, the programme
would now be managed by CDA’s Training and Education Division instead of
HPB. <em>eTeens</em> is conducted in two segments – a mass talk segment and
a classroom-based programme. The desired outcome of the <em>eTeens</em> programme
is that students are empowered to make wise, informed and sensible decisions
to protect themselves from sexually transmitted infectious diseases.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students are taught skills such
as decision-making, assertiveness and negotiation to say “no” to sex and
negative peer pressure. They also learn that the impact of STIs/HIV extends
beyond themselves and involves their family, and the importance of responsible
decision-making and seeking help. Abstinence and upholding family values
are the key messages.</p>
<p><strong>At Yusof Ishak Secondary School Secondary School, the <em>eTeens</em> programme will be implemented as follows in 2026:</strong>
