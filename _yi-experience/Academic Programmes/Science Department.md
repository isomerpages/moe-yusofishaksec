### Curriculum

**Vision**    
Confident, Self-directed learners who are Curious and Passionate about the natural and physical world.

**Mission**    
To provide a vibrant and authentic learning environment that will develop Yusoffians as Inquirers of Science.

**Inspire, Inquire, Innovate**    
Our Science curriculum aims to excite and nurture all students to be scientifically literate and provide strong Science fundamentals – in scientific knowledge, practices and values, for students to innovate and pursue STEM for future learning and work.

As part of our continual drive towards curriculum innovation and improvement, our team of Science educators actively design interactive learning activities and experiences to engage Yusoffians in the multi-dimensional learning of Science.

At Y.I, students are Innovative and Inspiring Inquirers.

*   **Inspired** by Science: Students are curious, appreciate learning scientific concepts and regard the subject as relevant to their lives.
*   **Inquire** like Scientists: Students are grounded in strong Science fundamentals, think critically and possess the spirit of scientific inquiry as they embrace the challenges faced.
*   **Innovate** using Science: Students extend their knowledge towards making responsible informed decisions to create solutions to solve many of our global challenges, to transform and improve the lives of others.

**STEMx**   
Our YI STEM Experiences (STEMx) programme adopts an integrative approach in providing a wide range of opportunities for Yusoffians to embrace and engage in STEM learning. They gain exposure to STEM through school-wide activities including urban farming and appreciating aeronautics through a hands-on workshop. Yusoffians also deepen their critical thinking skills through their participation in STEM-related curricula activities planned in collaboration with experts from the relevant fields, and in STEM-related competitions. STEMx provides a conducive environment for Yusoffians to immerse in and be empowered to make meaningful contributions to STEM-related areas in the future.
