### Curriculum

**Vision**    
Confident, Self-directed learners who are Curious and Passionate about the natural and physical world.

**Mission**    
To provide a vibrant and authentic learning environment that will develop Yusoffians as Inquirers of Science.

**Inspire, Inquire, Innovate**    
Our Science curriculum aims to excite and nurture all students to be scientifically literate and provide strong Science fundamentals – in scientific knowledge, practices and values, for students to innovate and pursue STEM for future learning and work.

As part of our continual drive towards curriculum innovation and improvement, our team of Science educators actively design interactive learning activities and experiences to engage Yusoffians in the multi-dimensional learning of Science.

At Y.I, students are Innovative and Inspiring Inquirers.

*   **Inspired**&nbsp;by Science: Students are curious, appreciate learning scientific concepts and regard the subject as relevant to their lives.
*   **Inquire**&nbsp;like Scientists: Students are grounded in strong Science fundamentals, think critically and possess the spirit of scientific inquiry as they embrace the challenges faced.
*   **Innovate**&nbsp;using Science: Students extend their knowledge towards making responsible informed decisions to create solutions to solve many of our global challenges, to transform and improve the lives of others.

### Learning Outcomes

**Lower Secondary Science**

The aims of the Lower Secondary Science G2 and G3 syllabuses are to:

1.      Cultivate students’ appreciation of Science as a collective human endeavour to understand the natural world, and as a way of thinking rather than just a body of facts.

2.      Inspire students to make informed decisions and take responsible actions in science-related issues that concern their lives, the society and the environment.

3.      Help students develop fundamentals that are integral to scientific inquiry and innovation, including problem-seeking and problem-solving.



The aims of the Lower Secondary Science G1 syllabus are to:

1.      Develop 21st century competencies in students.

2.      Guide students in acquiring knowledge, skills and values for application in their daily lives.

3.      Prepare students for future learning and work such that they become lifelong and motivated learners; and develop skills which are useful and relevant for them to be contributing citizens.



**Upper Secondary Biology, Chemistry and Physics**

The Upper Secondary Biology syllabus seeks to develop in students the understanding, skills, ethics and attitudes relevant to the practices of science, enabling them to:

1\. appreciate practical applications of Biology/ Chemistry/ Physics in the real world,    
2\.  deepen their interest in Biology/ Chemistry/ Physics for future learning and work,    
3\.  become scientifically literate citizens who can innovate and seize opportunities in the 21st century, and   


**_\[Biology\]_**&nbsp;develop a way of thinking to understand how living organisms work to sustain life and use the disciplinary ideas in Biology to approach, analyse and solve problems in biological systems.

**_\[Chemistry\]_**&nbsp;develop a way of thinking to approach, analyse and solve problems by explaining macroscopic characteristics and changes in chemical systems through the use of sub-microscopic and symbolic representations.

**_\[Physics\]_**&nbsp;appreciate that a small number of basic principles and disciplinary ideas can be applied to explain, analyse and solve problems in the physical world.

### Key Programmes

*   **Aeronautics Talk and Workshop (14 Jan 2021)**

At YI, our dream is for our Yusoffians to soar and expand their horizons! To help them realise this dream, we invited entrepreneur, engineer and educator, Professor Neo Kok Beng to share his wealth of experiences and inspire our Secondary 4 students.

This was complemented by a series of STEM Experience (STEMx) where students built gliders and had an up close experience with drones.

*   **Young Engineers’ Space (YES!) Programme (Feb – May 2021)**

In our collaboration with the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), a selected group of Yusoffians were invited to work with SIT undergraduates on hands-on, community-linked projects. This strategic partnership gives our Yusoffians exposure to STEM-related projects and allows them to be mentored by SIT undergraduates in the design thinking process.

Guided by their SIT mentors, our Secondary 4 students participated in this year’s collaborative project with Yio Chu Kang Single Member Constituency (YCK SMC) to address a need highlighted by the community.

*   **Electrochemistry Hands-on Activity on Fruit Battery (17 Mar 2021)**

Beyond the regular chemistry lesson, our Yusoffians had the opportunity to attend a hands-on activity conducted by Dr Apple Koh and Dr Maggie Pee from Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). In this electrochemistry fruit battery activity that has been modified with design thinking, cost consideration and optimisation, students learnt and applied the concepts of electrochemistry and redox reactions. Our students worked in groups in a challenge to build a fruit battery that was able to achieve cost and performance optimisation.

* **STEM Learning Fest (24 May 2022)**

Our inaugural YISS STEM Learning Fest, organised in partnership with the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), served to raise awareness in issues related to sustainability and engage students in exploring roles they can play as eco-stewards.

Students understood more about Energy Sustainability: Solar vs Other Sources through a presentation by Prof Ricky Ang,&nbsp;Head (Science, Mathematics and Technology), and Ng Teng Fong Chair Professor For SUTD-ZJU IDEA. Our pioneering cohort also learned about sustainability (including solar energy and biodegradable materials) through hands-on workshops conducted by faculty members of SUTD.

* **Space Exploration by NASA Astronaut Jeffrey Williams (6 June 2022)**

Our pioneering students were thrilled when they learnt that they would be able to meet retired NASA Astronaut Jeffrey Williams in-person during his physical visit to our campus! Students enthusiastically signed up to learn more about space exploration and to hear about space experiences from the astronaut himself ([https://go.gov.sg/spacejwjune2022](https://go.gov.sg/spacejwjune2022)) in this event organised in partnership with NEO Aeronautics.

Mr Williams shared many interesting facts, beautiful photographs and video clips taken during his past missions into space, address many questions raised by students and inspired our Yusoffians to work hard and reach for the stars.

* &nbsp;**A\*Star – MOE Scientist-In-School Programme (SiS) 2022**

MOE SiS aims to provide interested schools, and A\*STAR researchers an avenue to engage youth in research and activities to cultivate their interest in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). YISS is glad to work in partnership with Dr Micheal Chuah, Research Scientist in Robotics and Autonomous Systems, Institute for Infocomm Research, to organise activities to enthuse out students in real-world STEM.

Dr Chuah shared his journey and experiences in A\*Star with Yusoffians through a virtual assembly programme, showing them various applications of legged-robots in surveillance systems, search and rescue missions, building site inspections among others. Our STEM Club and Robotics Club CCA members had the opportunity to learn how to code and 3D print their own DIY Robot through a series of workshops conducted by Dr Chuah.

* **STEM Playground 2022**

STEM Playground is organised by CPDD, MOE to encourage students’ interest, curiosity, and creativity in STEM activities. Our Sec 1 Yusoffians courageously took up the challenge to explore and understand STEM concepts through the hands-on activities. They were creative in designing their prototypes and their active participation has led our school to emerge top 5 among at least 36 other schools in two consecutive challenges:

o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2nd&nbsp;in Challenge #2: Dome Sweet Dome    
o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4th&nbsp;in STEM Playground 2022 Challenge #1: So Car So Good!
