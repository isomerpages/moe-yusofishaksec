# **Design & Aesthetics**

### Curriculum

**DESIGN & TECHNOLOGY (D&T)**    
Design and Technology equips students with future ready skills such as user empathy and design thinking, and prepares students to explore rapidly changing technologies. Iterative design and make is taught at the lower secondary and design thinking through problem-based learning is applied at Upper Secondary. Students develop the quality of mindfulness, empathy and sensitivity through improving some aspects of their environment in everyday life. Through design and technology, students become discerning and informed users of products, and are nurtured as future innovators or creators.

**NUTRITION AND FOOD SCIENCE (NFS)**    
Food and Consumer Education (FCE) is offered at Lower Secondary while Food and Nutrition (F&N) is offered at Upper Secondary. Through this subject, students stay abreast on the latest developments in culinary and food technology, and demonstrate a sense of responsibility to share nutritional knowledge with family and the wider community. Through hand-on practical sessions, student-centred and independent learning, the NFS Unit nurtures students to be creative, resourceful, discerning and healthy individuals.

**ART**   
The art curriculum seeks to provide students with a balanced and well-rounded education in the aesthetic, cognitive and affective dimensions. Through engagement in art discourse/critique, the curriculum promotes lifelong enjoyment and appreciation of artistic works; developing visual literacy in students. Production of artwork encourages imagination and cultivates in students the capacity to innovate and improvise, preparing them to face future challenges.

**MUSIC**   
The subject is offered at lower secondary and aims to develop the students’ musical abilities. Through music performing and creating, our music curriculum creates a platform to provide every student with a basic music education and to grow extra-musical skills such as critical thinking skills, psychomotor skills, social awareness, and moral and cultural values. These are important to the holistic development of a student, better prepare them to thrive in a fast-changing and highly-connected world.

### Common Curriculum

As part of the school’s implementation of Full Subject-based Banding, lower secondary students will take a set of subjects at a common level. These subjects include Design & Technology, Food and Consumer Education, Art and Music. Designed to provide accessibility to all students, the common curriculum gives students the opportunity to learn in a nurturing and diverse environment. Through the use of pedagogies like scaffolding and differential instructions, students can grow at different pace to reach their full potential.
