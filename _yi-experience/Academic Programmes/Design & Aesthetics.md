<h1><strong>Design &amp; Aesthetics</strong></h1>
<h3>Curriculum</h3>
<p><strong>DESIGN &amp; TECHNOLOGY (D&amp;T)</strong>
<br>Design and Technology equips students with future ready skills such as
user empathy and design thinking, and prepares students to explore rapidly
changing technologies. Iterative design and making is taught at Lower Secondary
and design thinking through problem-based learning is applied at Upper
Secondary. Students&nbsp;develop the quality of mindfulness, empathy and
sensitivity through improving aspects of their environment in everyday
life.&nbsp;Through D&amp;T, students become discerning and informed users
of products, and are nurtured as future innovators or creators.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>NUTRITION AND FOOD SCIENCE (NFS)</strong>
<br>Food and Consumer Education (FCE) is offered at Lower Secondary while
Nutrition and Food Science (NFS) is offered at Upper Secondary. Through
these subjects, students stay abreast of the latest developments in culinary
and food technology, while developing an understanding of food, nutrition
and cross-cultural awareness in today’s globalised context. Through hands-on
practical sessions that encourage independent learning, FCE and NFS nurture
students to become creative, innovative, and resourceful individuals who
advocate sustainable food consumption and are capable of making informed
and discerning decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>ART</strong>
<br>The art curriculum seeks to provide students with a balanced and well-rounded
education in the aesthetic, cognitive and affective dimensions. Through
engagement in art discourse/critique, the curriculum promotes lifelong
enjoyment and appreciation of artistic works; developing visual literacy
in students. Production of artwork encourages imagination and cultivates
in students the capacity to innovate and improvise, preparing them to face
future challenges.</p>
<p><strong>MUSIC</strong>
<br>The subject is offered at lower secondary and aims to&nbsp;develop the
students’ musical abilities. Through music performing and creating, our
music curriculum creates a platform to provide every student with a basic
music education and to grow extra-musical skills such as critical thinking
skills, psychomotor skills, social awareness, and moral and cultural values.
These are important to the holistic development of a student, better prepare
them to thrive in a fast-changing and highly-connected world.</p>
<h3>Common Curriculum</h3>
<p>As part of the school’s implementation of Full Subject-based Banding,
lower secondary students will take a set of subjects at a common level.
These subjects include Design &amp; Technology, Food and Consumer Education,
Art and Music. Designed to provide accessibility to all students, the common
curriculum gives students the opportunity to learn in a nurturing and diverse
environment. Through the use of pedagogies like scaffolding and differential
instructions, students can grow at different pace to reach their full potential.</p>
