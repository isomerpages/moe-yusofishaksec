# **Humanities Department**

### Curriculum

**Vision**    
Thinkers and leaders who are equipped with future-ready skills to contribute knowledge and advocate for greater good and sustainable development of their community and the world.

**Mission**    
To foster a passion for lifelong learning through a learner-centred and authentic learning environment that will develop Yusoffians as inquirers and critical thinkers.

**Connect, Practice, Change**   
As part of our continual drive towards curriculum innovation, our team of Humanities educators actively design learner-centred lessons that encourage metacognition as they develop the different disciplinary skills. This is realised through a robust curriculum anchored on Inquiry Based Learning. Our lessons also encourage active participation, exploration, discovery and collaboration among learners. We also draw on real world knowledge of local and global context to make learning authentic to prepare them for life-long learning. The programme also helps to develop students’ critical thinking skills and a sense of civic mindedness where they discover their interests and strengths to pursue and advocate on issues that they are passionate about to advocate for collective well-being and sustainable development of their community and the world.

### Key Programmes

**Issues Investigation**    
Since 2017, the department has created varied experiences for our students to explore contemporary issues. The curriculum has been designed to allow for students to gather authentic data through interviews and make informed decisions by synthesising the information that they have gathered on an issue of interest to them. This grounds-up approach to Issue Investigation has been shared with members of the fraternity through Masterclasses to further deepen students’ interest in the community they live in and how they can do their part as participative citizens.
