<h1><strong>Humanities Department</strong></h1>
<h3>Curriculum</h3>
<p><strong>Vision</strong>
<br>Thinkers and leaders who are equipped with future-ready skills to contribute
knowledge and advocate for greater good and sustainable development of
their community and the world.</p>
<p><strong>Mission</strong>
<br>To foster a passion for lifelong learning through a learner-centred and
authentic learning environment that will develop Yusoffians as inquirers
and critical thinkers.</p>
<p><strong>Connect, Practice, Change</strong>
<br>As part of our continual drive towards curriculum innovation, our team
of Humanities educators actively design learner-centred lessons that encourage
metacognition as they develop the different disciplinary skills. This is
realised through a robust curriculum anchored on Inquiry Based Learning.
Our lessons also encourage active participation, exploration, discovery
and collaboration among learners. We also draw on real world knowledge
of local and global context to make learning authentic to prepare them
for life-long learning. The programme also helps to develop students’ critical
thinking skills and a sense of civic mindedness where they discover their
interests and strengths to pursue and advocate on issues that they are
passionate about to advocate for collective well-being and sustainable
development of their community and the world.</p>

<p><strong><u>Conquering New Horizons: NUS Geography Challenge</u></strong>
</p>
<p>In 2024, four students represented the school in the NUS Geography Challenge,
an annual competition organized by the NUS Department of Geography and
the Geographical Society. Themed "Urban Odyssey: Rediscovering our Landscapes
and Places", the competition was about encouraging participants to explore
local landscapes and critically assess the relationship between culture
and nature within urban environments. The NUS Geography Challenge provided
students with an invaluable opportunity to engage in geographical discussions
and shape their understanding of urban futures.</p>

<p><strong><u>Unraveling History: Historical Scene Investigation Challenge&nbsp;</u></strong>
</p>
<p>As part of our efforts to encourage students who have shown great interest
in History, Yusof Ishak Secondary has sent two teams every year to take
part in the Historical Scene Investigation Challenge, a contest organised
by the National Library Board. The competition provides a historical topic
to engage the participants in research, report writing and video production.This
allows students to exercise their creativity, be independent learners and
to learn with inquisitiveness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using online and offline platforms, teachers work closely with the students
during the competition period to support the students in producing the
final products to the best of their abilities.&nbsp;</p>
