<h1><strong>English Language &amp; Literature Department</strong></h1>
<h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
<p>At YISS, we seek to develop students to be empathetic and global communicators,
critical and discerning readers, and creative inquirers and meaning-makers
through English Language and Literature in English. We believe that through
the appropriate and accurate use of standard English, appreciation of multiple
perspectives and opportunities to express their views, Yusoffians would
be able to communicate effectively and sensitively to a global audience.
We believe that reading extensively and intentionally would enable Yusoffians
to be avid, critical and lifelong readers, broadening their knowledge of
the world and sharpening their ability to think critically. We believe
that when Yusoffians explore and navigate multiple perspectives and ambiguities
in real world contexts, they would be able to creatively synthesise information
to co-construct knowledge and thrive in an increasingly complex world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The learning of English Language and Literature in English places our
students in a better position to make sense of the world, have a greater
understanding of who they are and how they can contribute towards the greater
good. Equipped with a strong command of the English Language and a deep
appreciation for Literature in English, Yusoffians would be able to <strong>Think</strong>, <strong>LearnandLead Better</strong>,
and positively influence the world around them.</p>
<h3>Teaching and Learning Approaches</h3>
<p>YISS’s English Language and Literature Department uses the Parallel Curriculum
Model (PCM) as a tool for curriculum planning. PCM promotes differentiation
and connections in the classroom, allowing teachers to design lessons that
meet the varying readiness levels, interests and passions of students.
The Core of the curriculum focuses on language skills and literary concepts
which are scaffolded in spiral progression across the students’ education
journey in the school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Curriculum of Connections focuses on age-appropriate, broad concepts
and themes that help students apply what they've learned from the Core
Curriculum. In the Curriculum of Practice, students engage in real-world
tasks, allowing them to develop skills as professionals within carefully
designed contexts. Lastly, the Curriculum of Identity provides opportunities
for students to reflect on their personal views and positions regarding
global social issues.</p>
<p>In the teaching of English Language and Literature, we incorporate the
use of metacognition skills to enhance the depth of student engagement
across the parallels of the curriculum. By encouraging students to think
about their own thinking, metacognition helps them make stronger connections
between macro concepts and core content in the Curriculum of Connections.
For example, quality questioning, the asking of open-ended and reflective
questions, guides students through authentic analysis and interpretation
of texts, mirroring the work of literary scholars in the Curriculum of
Practice. Finally, this approach enables students to critically examine
their own values and perspectives, fostering personal growth and deeper
engagement with social themes in the Curriculum of Identity.</p>

<h3>Key Programmes</h3>
<h4>Speak Good English Movement (SGEM) Week</h4>
<p>The annual SGEM week seeks to deepen the appreciation for the English
Language and spark creativity in using the language. Students sharpen their
language skills in dynamic ways, such as participating in thrilling spelling
bees, book art and character snapshots competitions, and other interesting
activities throughout the week. Whether crafting poems, solving riddles
or presenting speeches, SGEM week makes learning the English language enjoyable
and meaningful for students.</p>
