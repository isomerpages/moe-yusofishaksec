# **English Language & Literature Department**

### Curriculum

Our mission is to empower every child that comes through Y.I. to develop their personal voice by igniting their passion and curiosity about the world via language and Literature.

Our English Language programme is tailored to give students the tools to help them adapt in an increasingly complex world by expressing themselves confidently and making meaning of what they experience. We leverage on the use of e-pedagogy to create collaborative and self-directed learning experiences for our students.

Our Literature programme aims to instill in our students a deep sense of understanding about ourselves and others through the texts we experience. We equip our students with the skills to sharpen their analytical thinking and appreciate the nuances and beauty of the English Language.
