### Key Programmes

**MTL Reading Programme**

Reading constitutes a fundamental element of language literacy. Proficient reading skills not only benefit students during their academic journey but also empower them for continuous learning and lifelong success. Reading plays a pivotal role in expanding vocabulary, fostering analytical thinking, and broadening students' perspectives on the world around them.

Through our MTL Reading Programme, YI students engage in diverse reading materials on a weekly basis, encompassing various genres such as current news reports to keep them informed about ongoing events and literary texts that introduce the elegance and artistry of language. To further enrich the process of reading as an active learning experience, students actively participate in discussions during their lessons, allowing them to exchange ideas and negotiate meanings for enhanced comprehension in collaboration with their peers. This interactive learning approach will subsequently be demonstrated and reinforced in their writing endeavors.

**Empowering Language Learners: Metacognition, E-Pedagogy, and Assessment as Learning**

Language learning frequently involves active production, such as speaking and writing in the language being taught or learned. As expressed in the renowned words of American philosopher John Dewey, "We do not learn from an experience... we learn from reflecting on an experience." In the context of students learning Mother Tongue Languages (MTL), the incorporation of e-pedagogy and metacognition plays a pivotal role.

Through the integration of technology, students not only cultivate the habit of monitoring, evaluating, and planning for enhanced MTL productions within the school environment, but they also develop these valuable metacognitive skills that prepare them to become lifelong language learners well beyond their school years. This process shifts the focus from mere assessment of learning to assessment as learning, where students actively engage in self-assessment and reflection to optimize their language acquisition and production.

**MTL Fortnight Programme**

Every year, during the MTL Fortnight, the Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) Department orchestrates a dynamic array of activities that transform the learning experience for our students. These activities extend beyond the confines of the classroom, featuring immersive learning journeys to external cultural sites, fostering a deeper connection with MTL as a 'living language.'

The MTL Fortnight serves as a vibrant platform, providing students with authentic opportunities to engage with MTL and immerse themselves in the associated cultures. Through a diverse range of activities, students not only learn about their mother tongues but also get to experience the richness of their heritage firsthand.

Here's a glimpse of the culturally enriching activities our students participate in during the MTL Fortnight:
