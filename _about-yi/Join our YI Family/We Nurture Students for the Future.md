# **We Nurture Students for the Future**

At YI, we aspire to develop students with deep anchor of character and the 21CC skills through a robust Co-curricular Activity platform. We provide CCAs to cater to students with different interest and strengths, in Performing Arts, Sports, Uniformed Groups and Clubs. Our Uniformed Groups, such as NCC and NPCC, have achieved sustained gold awards in HQ recognition annually. The Performing Arts CCAs have won SYF distinctions in several categories. Our clubs are actively involved in community programmes and have also clinched national-level awards in inter-school competitions. At the heart of the achievements, students learned to adopt the growth mind-set and develop leadership dispositions.

Talent development is key. Through subject-based application programmes, the school offers plenty of opportunities for our students to experience emerging cutting edge technologies and to participate in global and national competitions. As leaders for tomorrow, our students initiate transformational improvements to the school and community through the annual Student Conference and the Change Makers Programme.
