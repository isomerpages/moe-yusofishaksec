# **School Song**

We’ll strive and strain together    
To make our life anew   
We’ll build a better world tomorrow   
For the future’s in our hands   

Although of different origins    
We’re still one family  
Through day and night   
Through thick and thin  
We will always brothers be    

Merrily we sing, we sing merrily along     
As we wend our way     
Through tortuous paths   
Definitely we’ll, we will definitely build   
A better world   
A better world   
We’ll build a better world tomorrow
