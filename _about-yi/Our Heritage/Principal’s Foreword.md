We are delighted to welcome our pioneering cohort of students and their parents to our YI BIG Family!

At Yusof Ishak Secondary School, the Centre for Teaching & Learning Excellence (CTLE@YISS), our mission is to develop our students to be curious, creative and confident life-long leaners who contribute to the Greater Good. We are **BIG** in nurturing our students as **Leaders for Tomorrow**:

**Believe** \- We believe every child has talent    
**Inspire** \- We inspire every child to learn for life     
**Grow** \- We grow every child to shine and serve


We nurture our students to soar to their best and shine their brightest. Through thoughtfully designed academic and student development experiences, we endeavour to develop our students holistically to be future-ready. Our students commence their learning journey with confidence, where joy is part of the journey and love is the heart of the journey!

We seek to **InSPIRE** our students to develop good character through our school values:

* Live with **In**tegrity
* Lead with **S**elf-respect
* Collaborate with a **P**urpose
* Learn with **I**nquisitiveness
* Grow with **R**esilience
* Serve with **E**mpathy

Fondly known as the First President School, our vision is to nurture students who can think, learn and lead better. Through the **YI Future-ready Leaders Programmes (FLP)**, our students will acquire **Future-Ready Habits (FRH)** such as inquisitiveness and ideation. As part of the YI FLP, our distinctive programmes serves to provide meaningful and authentic contexts where knowledge can be applied, and values, 21st Century Competencies and FRH can be developed, demonstrated and strengthened.

Our Applied Learning Programme is **STEM** for the **S**trategic Development of a **S**ustainable and **S**mart City **(S4TEM@YI)**. Exposing our students to STEM Learning & Values serve to equip them with the skills and dispositions of Leaders for Tomorrow such as Lateral Thinkers, Ethical Advocates & Digital Innovators. Our Learning for Life Programme is **Nurturing Honourable Leaders for Tomorrow (YI LEAD+)**. We provide a strong school culture and myriad of opportunities to nurture an Honourable Leader in every student, anchored in the core values of honourable leaders.

Our school theme for 2022 is **Pioneering as ONE**! Emulating the pioneering spirit of our First President Mr Yusof Ishak, it is our hope that our students will embrace challenges in lives and achieve breakthroughs as we work together as one to build a brighter future for ourselves and Singapore. As we embark on this new journey in 2022, we will continue to champion the joy of learning through the provision of a holistic curriculum and cutting-edge pedagogies. We will also grow our students as way makers who possess a global outlook and have a positive growth mindset, inspiring changes in our society through their speech and actions.

In our endeavours, we seek to build a synergistic home-school partnership to nurture our students to their fullest potential. We hope to work hand-in-hand with parents/guardians so that our students develop self-management and self-regulation skills, take responsibility and ownership of their learning and build resilience.

We are grateful for the strong support from our key stakeholders, namely School Advisory Committee, YI Parent Support Group (YI PSG) and alumni. This strong support from our key stakeholders, coupled with our competent, committed and caring teachers will imbue in our students the joy of learning and contribute to the provision of a quality holistic education. We are confident that we will continue to achieve many more breakthroughs in the years ahead as we scale new heights as way-makers!

We look forward to welcoming you to Yusof Ishak Secondary School, the First President School!

Take care and keep well! Wishing everyone a Happy & Healthy 2022!

Learn for Life,
