<h4>Welcome to Yusof Ishak Secondary School!</h4>
<p></p>
<p>As we step into 2026, I am honoured to continue leading the YI Family
in our ongoing journey of excellence and innovation.</p>
<p>Last year marked an important milestone for our school as we celebrated
our 60th anniversary. As we move forward, we rededicate ourselves to our
goal of nurturing Yusoffians to be Leaders for Tomorrow and Leaders for
the Greater Good. This endeavour continues to guide everything we do at
Yusof Ishak Secondary School, reminding us that our work extends beyond
academic achievement to developing young people who will make meaningful
contributions to society.</p>
<p>2025 also marked 10 years of hosting the Centre for Teaching &amp; Learning
Excellence (CTLE@YISS), a partnership with the Academy of Singapore Teachers,
and the National Institute of Education. Over these 10 years, this collaboration
has enriched not just our school but the wider teaching fraternity as well.
Going forward, we remain committed to exploring new pedagogies and approaches
that will prepare our students for an ever-changing world.</p>
<p>2026 marks our 5th year here at our Sumang Walk campus. I am deeply grateful
for the unwavering support from our parents and the wider community here
in Punggol. Your partnership has been instrumental in creating a vibrant
learning environment where our Yusoffians can thrive and grow.</p>
<p>Beyond our campus, we will continue to do our part as a school to serve
the community. Contributing to the greater good is not just something we
teach – it is something we model and practice together as a school community.
Through our various outreach programmes and partnerships, we hope to make
a positive difference in the lives of those around us.</p>
<p>I look forward to a good year of learning ahead. To our future Yusoffians,
YI parents, and YI staff, I warmly welcome you. Together, we will continue
growing YI from strength to strength, building on our heritage and creating
new possibilities for the future.</p>
<p>Here's to an inspiring and fulfilling 2026!</p>
<p>Mr Chen Ziyang</p>
<p>Principal</p>
