<h1><strong>Principal’s Welcome</strong></h1>
<p></p>
<h4>Welcome to Yusof Ishak Secondary School!</h4>
<p>I am Mr Chen Ziyang, the new Principal at Yusof Ishak Secondary School.
I am excited to join the YI Family and honoured to take over the leadership
baton from Mdm Maureen Lee.</p>
<p>First, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mdm Maureen Lee
for her inspirational leadership, courage and deep care for her students
and staff. Under her steadfast leadership, she led the school through COVID-19,
oversaw the move of the school to 8 Sumang Walk and worked with the YI
team to curate an exceptional school experience for Yusoffians.</p>
<p>When I first stepped into the school and walked around the spaces, my
first impression was the excitement I felt as an educator. Classrooms with
desks on wheels, with whiteboards at the front and back to allow for quick
transitions between whole-class and group activities; art rooms that open
up to an outdoor garden where students can create and express their ideas
in nature; a canteen where staff and students pre-order and self-collect
their meals to reduce food waste. These are just some of the bold ideas
that are carefully designed and incorporated into the school campus.</p>
<p>In addition, beyond the spaces, the people at Yusof Ishak have touched
and inspired me. Every staff I’ve met, teaching and non-teaching alike,
are proud to be part of this journey to push the boundaries of teaching
and learning and sharing with the larger fraternity. We are privileged
to host the Centre for Teaching &amp; Learning Excellence (CTLE@YISS) where
we partner Master Teachers from the Academy of Singapore Teachers, professors
from the National Institute of Education and experts from the Ministry
of Education to innovate and share best practices.</p>
<p>I look forward to continuing this exciting journey of innovation, collaboration
and partnership with Yusoffians, parents and stakeholders.</p>
<p>2025 will also be a milestone for the school. We will be celebrating our
60<sup>th</sup> anniversary, together with our nation as well as the 10<sup>th</sup> year
of hosting CTLE@YISS. It will be a meaningful year for us as we remember
our past and nurture our Yusoffians to be Leaders for Tomorrow.</p>
<p>Wishing everyone a fulfilling year of learning and growth in 2025!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mr Chen Ziyang</p>
<p>Principal</p>
