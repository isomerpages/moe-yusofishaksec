After two pioneering years at 8 Sumang Walk, it is our hope that our students will continue to possess the courage to step out of their comfort zone and take ownership to shape the next chapter of the school’s journey.</p><p>As a school, we will cultivate an abundance mindset and work together as one to build a brighter future for ourselves and Singapore. As we embark on this new journey in 2024, we will continue to champion the joy of learning through the provision of a holistic curriculum and cutting-edge pedagogies, with <strong><em>EdTech as a Capability Multiplier</em></strong>. We will also grow our students as way makers who possess a global outlook and have a positive growth mindset, inspiring changes in our society through their speech and actions.</p><p>In our endeavours, we seek to build a synergistic home-school partnership to nurture our students to their fullest potential. We hope to work hand-in-hand with parents/guardians so that our students develop self-management and self-regulation skills, take responsibility and ownership of their learning and build resilience.</p><p>We are grateful for the strong support from our key stakeholders, namely School Advisory Committee, YI Parent Support Group (YI PSG) and alumni. This strong support from our key stakeholders, coupled with our competent, committed and caring teachers will imbue in our students the joy of learning and contribute to a quality holistic education for them. We are confident that we will continue to achieve many more breakthroughs in the years ahead as we scale new heights as way-makers!</p><p>We look forward to welcoming you to Yusof Ishak Secondary School, the First President School!
