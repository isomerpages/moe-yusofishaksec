Yusof Ishak Secondary School was established in 1965 as Jubilee Integrated Secondary School. It was an integrated school offering secondary education to an enrolment of 984 pupils and 37 teachers of two streams, in English and Malay.

On 29 July 1966, then Prime Minister, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew declared open Yusof Ishak Secondary School (YISS) at Jubilee Road. We are the only school to be named after a President of our Republic.

In 1992, we became the first school to top the value-added ranking in both the Express and Normal Streams.

We are honored to be named after the first President of Singapore, Encik Yusof Bin Ishak. Even though the physical learning environment posed a challenge, our students were undeterred in their quest for knowledge. On the contrary, the ‘kampong feel’, coupled with the support from the teachers, led them to greater heights of academic excellence.

YI remained to be the only school to be named after the First President of Singapore. Besides being a respected Statesman, Mr. Yusof Ishak was also a Scholar and a prolific Sportsman. To Yusoffians, he is a true son of Singapore whom we look up to as one who is responsible, resilient, respectful, confident, compassionate and one who exemplifies the integrity of character – qualities which Yusoffians embrace.

  

### Heritage Gallery

YISS Heritage Gallery was officially declared open by Mr Heng Swee Keat, Minister for Education on 23 September 2015. Puan Noor Aishah, wife of our first President, Mr Yusof bin Ishak was also present at the ceremony.

Our Heritage Gallery celebrates the life of our nation’s first President, Mr Yusof Bin Ishak, whom the school has the honour of being the only school in Singapore to be named after a President. Our Heritage Gallery highlights the three principles embodied in Mr Yusof Bin Ishak – the principles of meritocracy, multiracialism and modernisation.

Our Heritage Gallery serves to preserve the pioneering spirit, and documents the establishment, development and the rich history of the school since it started in 1965. The artefacts, photographs, memorabilia and publications feature significant moments and acknowledge the great contributions of our first President to our nation as well as the collective work of Principals and staff who have led and served the school over the years.

Our Heritage Gallery is made possible through the generosity of our School Advisory Committee, led by Mr Eric Lim. It is also supported by the National Heritage Board.

During the official opening, our former school leaders and long-serving staff were also present to mark the momentous occasion. Their pioneering spirit, strength and resilience have laid the firm foundation for Yusof Ishak Secondary School, upon which we shall continue to forge ahead and scale new heights.

Let us look forward to our next 50 years ahead!
