# **Centre for Teaching and Learning Excellence**

Our school is honoured to host the Centre for Teaching and Learning Excellence (CTLE). CTLE@YISS features an in-situ PD model where teacher learning occurs within the context of the classroom, through masterclasses and demonstration classes.

CTLE is supported by a tripartite partnership involving Master Teachers (MTTs) from the Academy of Singapore Teachers (AST), experts from the National Institute of Education (NIE), and teaching staff from the hosting school.
