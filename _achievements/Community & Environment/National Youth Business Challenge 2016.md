# **National Youth Business Challenge 2016**

On 17 July, Y.I. Greenhearts@Work participated in the National Youth Business Challenge 2016 (NYBC) organised by Ngee Ann Polytechnic and was awarded the Silver Award and the Most Attractive Display Award.

Only 40 schools were selected based on their business concept proposals and YISS was one of them. This led the team to embark on their earth-friendly venture. Students sourced for and created their items (quite a tongue-twister, ‘produced the products’ – please change), worked out their own finances and merchandise and finally marketed them at Changi City Point Shopping Centre, Basement Atrium.

Plastic bottles, soft drink cans, used butter lamps, shampoo/body wash bottles, glass bottles and plastic bags had a new leash of life when they were skilfully made into earth-friendly and useful items like cell phone holders, plastic bottles hanging plants, terrariums, wind chimes, handmade wallets, water container aquariums.

Students not only learnt to manage their Earth-Friendly business but also, the importance of being environmentally-conscious.
