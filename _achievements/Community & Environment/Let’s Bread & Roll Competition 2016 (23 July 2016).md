Four students represented the school to take part in the Let’s Bread and Roll competition organised by Lam Soon Community on 23 July 2016. It served as a platform for students to exhibit their creativity while planning healthy meals.

Our students Tharshini Chantharan (2E1) and Lee Ailia Ali (2E1) won 2nd position under Category B while Hee Kit Yee (3N1B) and M Aishwarya (3N1B) walked away with more experience having created such healthy meals on the go.
