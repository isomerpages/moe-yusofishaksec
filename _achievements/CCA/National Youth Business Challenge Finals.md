# **National Youth Business Challenge Finals**

The National Youth Business Challenge (NYBC) Finals 2017 took place on 16 July 2017 at Changi City Point Shopping Centre. It was organised by the School of Business & Accountancy, Ngee Ann Polytechnic.

In line with the Ministry of Education’s thrust to foster awareness of the importance of eco-friendly businesses, NYBC challenged students to develop an eco-friendly business concept, produce the products and market them at a shopping mall.

The students were taught essential practical business skills and knowledge to set up eco-friendly businesses in an effective and creative manner. They also learnt how to present and give sales and marketing speeches confidently.

The business proposal of the school’s Interact Club was shortlisted for the Finals. Members of The Interact Club had the opportunity to market their eco-friendly business and sell the eco-friendly products through an effective sales pitch. 

The Interact Club did our school proud by clinching Silver Award and the Most Creative & Innovative Award.
