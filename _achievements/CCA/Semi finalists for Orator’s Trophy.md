# **Semi-finalists for Orator’s Trophy**

Two of our students qualified for the Semi-final round of the 2017 Orator's Trophy Competition held at ACJC on 18th Feb. The students were required to deliver speeches with topics given to them only minutes before the delivery. Both of them did the school proud by coming in overall top 20 speakers among the numerous schools that took part. Good job Pradhan Anushka Viraj (2/1) and Putri Nur Athirah (4/2B).
