# **Singapore Mathematical Olympiad 2017**

The Singapore Mathematical Olympiad (SMO) 2017 consists of three categories, Junior, Senior and Open where students are streamed according to age. The competition took place in Yusof Ishak Secondary School on 30 May 2017, for Junior and Senior categories, and 31 May 2017, for Open category.

Students are required to use their knowledge of the mathematics syllabus to solve challenging questions. Questions are often indirect and require thinking out of the box and using topics, which may seem to have no links at first glance, to solve questions quickly and efficiently.

The competition aims to foster resilience in students and that continuous learning coupled with practice, even for the areas that may seem familiar to them, are key to tackle the most challenging questions. (Life-Long Learning). 29 of our students took part in the SMO.

Our students made us proud by obtaining two bronze and two honourable mentions. This is a great improvement from 2016 where there was only one student who obtained honourable mention.

Honourable mentions are awarded to the top 26 – 40% of students and bronze are awarded to the top 10 – 25% of students.

The rest of our Junior, Senior and Open category students put in their best efforts and were awarded the certificates of participation.

The names of the students, classes and the category they participated in are shown below:

| Name 	| Class 	| Category 	| Award 	|
|---	|---	|---	|---	|
| Hee Chee Seng 	| 4/1 	| Senior 	| Bronze 	|
| Pwint Thiri Ko 	| 3/1 	| Senior 	| Bronze 	|
| Wang Zichen 	| 4/1 	| Open 	| Honourable Mention 	|
| Hur Juhee 	| 3/1 	| Senior 	| Honourable Mention 	|

Teachers and students gained valuable knowledge and skills in tackling Mathematical Olympiad questions.

Many students relished in the satisfaction of attempting to solve tough questions and are looking forward to the challenge again in next year’s SMO.
