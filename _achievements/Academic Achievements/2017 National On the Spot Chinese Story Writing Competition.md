# **2017 National On-the-Spot Chinese Story Writing Competition**

One of our students, Zhu Yuhong of Sec 2/1, had clinched the third position at the 2017 National On-the-Spot Chinese Story Writing Competition which was held at the Anglican High School on 3 March 2017 (Friday). The objective of the competition is to provide a platform for Primary and Secondary school students to showcase their creative writing skills in the Chinese language. Yuhong had done our school proud as she had outshined other participants from renowned institutions such as National Junior College, Nan Chiau High School, River Valley High School, Anderson Secondary School and Nan Hua High School to win the title. It was indeed a fierce competition and yet Yuhong earned a place in the top three positions at the national level. Let us continue to nurture our students and provide them with ample opportunities to excel in their niche areas.
