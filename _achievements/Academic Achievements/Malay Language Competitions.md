# **Malay Language Competitions**

**November 6, 2020**

Earlier this year, our Yusoffians participated and did us proud in two Malay Language competitions! For the Inter-Secondary School Translation Competition: 3T (Terjemah. Tutur. Tepat!) organised by National Junior College, our Yusoffians emerged as the overall winner! The students are: Nureen Amyssa (3/2A), Syarifah Asyura (3/2A) and Muhammad Nasrul (3/2B). For the Malay Language Essay Writing Competition, Anugerah Pena Emasku 2020, our Yusoffians took home 14 Gold awards and 1 Silver award. Heartiest congratulations to all our Yusoffians!
