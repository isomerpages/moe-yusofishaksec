# **Inter-Secondary School Translation Competition 2020**

**August 20, 2020**

In April, a team of 3E ML students participated in the Inter-Secondary School Translation Competition: 3T (Terjemah. Tutur. Tepat!) organised by National Junior College.

3T is a competition that hones studentsâ€™ proficiency in translation (from English language to Malay Language and vice-versa) both spontaneously and creatively, based on the context provided. This competition serves to expose students to various situations where bilingualism is used in our daily lives.

**We are happy to share that our students have performed well and has emerged as first position!**

The students are:

**1) Nureen Amyssa 3/2A**   
**2) Syarifah Asyura 3/2A**   
**3) Muhammad Nasrul 3/2B**

We would like to congratulate these students for their commitment in the competition and bringing pride to our school.
