Six students represented the school in the 14th National Secondary School Chinese Creative Writing Competition organized by the Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan, Singapore Literary Society, Nan Chiau High School and “Zaobao Comma” on 1 April 2016.

This national competition aims to promote the use of the Chinese Language and interest in creative writing among secondary school students. It was an enriching learning experience for all the student participants. We would like to congratulate Zhang Yimei of Sec 3E1 for clinching the 3rd prize in this competition.
