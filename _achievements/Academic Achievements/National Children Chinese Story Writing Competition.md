# **National Children Chinese Story Writing Competition**

It was yet another moment of pride as two of our Yusoffians had each bagged an award in the “Creativity, No Boundaries!” National Children’s Chinese Story Writing Competition that was held at Guangyang Secondary School on 24 September 2016. The competition was jointly organised by the Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning and the Singapore Centre for Chinese Language, and it had garnered enthusiastic support from schools and the community.

Yang Huiyuan from Sec 2/2 had emerged as one of the champions in the Lower Secondary category, sharing the joy of victory with Gao Mu Zi from Chong Boon Secondary School. On the other hand, Zhang Yimei from Sec 4/1 had clinched the second spot in the Upper Secondary category. The achievements by both students at the national level were certainly remarkable! They were amongst the 36 awardees whose stories were selected from a pool of 500 eligible entries. It was definitely a tough battle for Huiyuan and Yimei, and yet they were equally amazing to have progressed so far.

  

Huiyuan and Yimei were presented with their prizes by Ms Low Yen Ling, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Ministry of Education & Ministry of Trade and Industry, at an award ceremony that was held at the National Library Board on the morning of 26 August 2017. Huiyuan and Yimei each received a trophy, a Certificate of Accomplishment as well as $300 and $200 worth of cash vouchers respectively. Our Yusoffians’ award-winning entries will be published as a set of 36 Readers for local Primary students. The Readers will be published in two batches, with the first 18 books scheduled for the Publication Launch in July 2017, and the next 18 in April, 2018. Huiyuan and Yimei’s works will be published in the latter batch.

Huiyuan was thrilled to learn that she was one of those who had topped the Lower Secondary category. She exclaimed, “I am thankful to be given the opportunity to represent the school, and I am glad that I have done my school proud. The award is a recognition of my efforts, and I will continue to do my best in future competitions.” Says a beaming Yimei, “It was such a wonderful opportunity for me to make use of my imagination and creativity to pen a story for young children.” She added, “I am honoured to be one of the award recipients in this national competition.”
