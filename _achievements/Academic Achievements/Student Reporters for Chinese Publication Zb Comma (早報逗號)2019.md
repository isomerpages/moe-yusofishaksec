# **Student Reporters for Chinese Publication Zb Comma (早報逗號)2019**

We are proud to share that two students Tian Ni (2/1) and Liu Yilin (2/3), have passed three rounds of interviews and being selected as student reporters (联合学生通讯员) for the Chinese newspaper “Zaobao Comma” owned by Singapore Press Holdings (SPH).

Tian Ni and Yilin will be trained by professional journalists on how to conduct interviews and write news articles. They will have the opportunity to publish their news articles on the publication featuring reports of our school activities and other nationwide events with guidance from Mdm You Lixia in these 2-3 years.
