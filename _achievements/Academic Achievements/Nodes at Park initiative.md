# **Nodes at Park initiative**

![](/images/academicachievement4.jpg)

YISS is proud to be one of seven secondary schools participating in National Library Board's latest 'Nodes at Parks' initiative. This initiative includes a roving exhibition of painted benches that allow viewers to access NLB's e-resources focused on Sustainability. Applying what they have learnt from our school's ALP in STEM and Sustainability, YISS Art Club students have designed and painted two benches based on the theme "What Can Be Done to Mitigate Climate Change". Qaseh Fatehah (1 Purpose) and Ms Amanda Lim represented the school at the launch event last Friday, graced by SPS Mr Baey Yam Keng. Spot our benches at Gardens by the Bay (near the Golden Gardens) from 14 October to 22 November!
