# **Singapore Junior Physics Olympiad 2017**

The Singapore Junior Physics Olympiad (SJPO) consists of two categories, Main and Open, where students are streamed according to age.

SJPO provides students the opportunity to solve novel physics questions that require critical and inventive thinking. (Scholars) 

It also aims to spur studentsâ€™ continued interest in the study and appreciation of physics beyond the school curriculum. (Curiosity and Lifelong Learning)

6 students from class 3/1 and 4/1 were identified to participate in the 10th SJPO 2017. Students sat for the General Round of the competition on 19th May 2017 at Yusof Ishak Secondary School for both categories. This was the first time our school participated in SJPO.
