# **Ngee Ann Poly Math Challenge 2017**

On 28th March, selected students from Sec 4/1, Sec 5/1 and a handful of 4N students took part in the math challenge organised by and also held at Ngee Ann Polytechnic.

This competition gives our students the exposure in Mathematics competition, build confidence in problem-solving by applying mathematics concepts and cultivate love and passion for mathematics.

Our students compete as two teams against teams from other secondary schools. The event comprises of games and quizzes. In the games segment, students worked in their respective teams to solve puzzles and problems presented using mathematical concepts. Each participant sat for an online quiz towards the end of the competition.

Both teams made us proud. For Session 2 Games, our teams came in 2nd runner-up and 1st runner-up respectively. For Session 2 Quizzes, our Sec 4/1 team won the 1st position.

Students were also presented with vouchers.
