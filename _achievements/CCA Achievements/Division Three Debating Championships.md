# **Division Three Debating Championships**

On 14th January, 14 students from YISS Debate Club took part in the annual Division 3 Debating Championships (D3DC 2017) held at Loyang Secondary School. One of our Yusoffians, Putri Nur Athirah from Class 4/2B did our school proud and came in overall 6th Best Speaker among numerous students from 22 schools. We congratulate our student debaters and wish them all the best for their upcoming competitions!
