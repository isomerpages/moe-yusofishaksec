# **Australian Mathematics Competition**

The 2017 edition of the Australian Mathematics Competition (AMC) was held on 27 July 2017 at Yusof Ishak Secondary School.

A total of 126 students took part in the annual competition which is meant to enrich our students’ learning of Mathematics beyond the confines of a classroom. In the students’ preparation for the competition, it provided a platform for them to solve everyday Mathematics problems creatively and confidently. (Lifelong Learning, confidence, creativity)

This year, the competition was extended to all Secondary One to Three students in the Express stream and selected students from classes 3/3, 4/1 and 5/1. To prepare the students for the competition, the Mathematics Department had infused selected questions from past AMC competition papers into the Mathematics Scheme of Works (SOWs).

Our students did us proud as 6 students obtained Distinctions, 21 obtained Credits and 83 obtained Proficiency Awards. The Best in School Award Winner was awarded to Wang Zichen from class 4/1.
