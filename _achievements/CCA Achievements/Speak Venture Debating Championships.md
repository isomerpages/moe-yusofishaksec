# **Speak Venture Debating Championships** 

Our student debaters took part in the recently concluded Speak Ventures Debating Championships (SVDC) that took place on 21st and 22nd of January at Tanglin Trust School. Despite facing many stronger and more experienced teams, our debate team did YISS proud by beating Nanyang Girls High School in the first prepared round. All three speakers from the team also came in as Best Speakers for the championships. Veronica Yvonne Gadil and Mohamad Givari Zulfan of class 4/1, were ranked 13th and 7th respectively for the ‘Silver’ Division for less experienced debate teams, while Putri Nur Athirah from class 4/2B performed well enough to be ranked 14th in the ‘Gold’ Division which is reserved for more experienced debate teams. We wish our debate team all the best for the upcoming Singapore Secondary Schools Debating Championships that will begin on 10th February.
