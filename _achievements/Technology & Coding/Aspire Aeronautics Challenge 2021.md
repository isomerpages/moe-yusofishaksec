# **Aspire Aeronautics Challenge 2021**

We are proud of our students, Chantelle and Nathaniel, who have won cash prizes and seed funding in Phase 1 (Ideation) of the ASPIRE Challenge where they develop Innovative Improvements and Applications of Urban Mobility Vehicles. We look forward to greater innovations from our Yusoffians!
