# **Design for Good Youth Competition**

**November 3, 2020**

Yusoffians from the Interact Club and New Media Club took part in the 2020 Design For Good Youth Competition, where they designed a poster to create awareness for the better use of the Internet. We are delighted to announce that out of 500 entries, the design of three Yusoffians, Chantelle Sim, Syarifah Asyura and Wheaton Wong, emerged as one of the 35 winning entries for the competition!
