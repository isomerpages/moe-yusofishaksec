<h4><strong>Message to 4NA/4NT Yusoffians and Parents/Guardians</strong></h4>
<p>The 2025 GCE N-Level results will be released soon. As we await the release,
we encourage both students and parents/guardians to take time to acknowledge
and celebrate the efforts put in over the years, regardless of the outcomes.
Examination results represent one milestone in a longer learning journey
and do not define a student’s worth, character or potential.</p>
<p>This period can be both exciting and challenging. The support and understanding
of parents/guardians, together with open and encouraging conversations,
play an important role in helping students reflect on their experiences
and consider their next steps with confidence and clarity.</p>
<h4><strong>Resources and Support</strong></h4>
<p>For information on social and emotional support, education and career
guidance, as well as details on admissions exercises and post-secondary
programmes, students and parents/guardians may refer to the <a href="/files/Info_Sheet_for_Parents__N_Level_.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Info Sheet for Parents</a> and
