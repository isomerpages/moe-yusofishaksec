# **We Leverage Technology for Learning**

We harness education technologies to support instructional objectives and create student-centric and engaging classrooms for our students. Our students own personal learning devices through the Personal Digital Learning Programme (PDLP). Through the school’s 1-to-1 computing programme, we enhance students’ learning experiences as thinking, discussion and interaction go beyond the physical environment.
