# **We Inspire**

### Our Teachers INSPIRE

We are the Centre for Teaching and Learning. Our teachers work with education researchers to create quality lessons that are impactful and fun.

At YI, our teachers inspire and ignite the imagination of our learners. The high expectation and trust between our teachers and students enable this journey of discovery and learning. Teachers model inquisitiveness and design probing questions to deepen students’ understanding and learning. Beyond mastering content knowledge, teachers also structure metacognitive goals for each lesson so that students also ‘know about knowing’ and thereby acquire the ability to adapt the learning to other areas.

Through CTLE, teachers collaborate with Master Teachers and Professors to deliver quality learning experiences for all our students.
